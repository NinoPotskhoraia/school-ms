# school-ms
This is a new version of my JavaScript project, where I created a prototype of School Management System. I built a responsive UI. The project uses array methods, ES6 classes, inheritence and other object oriented programming concepts. The database is just a local array of data objects. The user can add, read and remove subjects, students and teachers. I am planning to add the update option shortly.
